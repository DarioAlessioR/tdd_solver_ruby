# Project Name: TDD project

## Project description:
Implement a class with some methods doing test-driven development (TDD).

The app will allow to:

- evaluate factorial on an integer

- reverse a string

- apply "Fizzbuzz" on a given number

## Project Requirements:
- Create a class called Solver.

- Create a method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.

- Create a method called reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is "hello" it returns "olleh").

- Create a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").

- Start with tests for all of the methods described above. Commit history should prove the use of TDD.
